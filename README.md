# arcus
This repository was created to document the "arcus" keyboard project and release the project files for do-it yourself enthusiasts. 
The name is derived from the Latin word for arch, since the keyboard is of an arched (or curved, bowl-shaped) geometry.

## Files
There are two versions:
- A Kailh Choc (low-profile switch) compatible keyboard. 
- A Kailh Box and Cherry MX compatible (standard switch) keyboard.

## Design Features:
- Slots to add the corresponding hotswap sockets, diodes, and wiring.
- Modular thumb cluster
- Keycaps for both types of key switches

The keyboards are set up in a 6x4 matrix with a modular 5-Key thumb cluster, so overall there will be 58 keys.
The angles between the rows are 16 degrees and 12 degrees between the columns each.
The overall design is free floating and intended to be fixed to the desk by the 6-1 key. Other positions can work, depending on the thumb cluster position.
There is no case (maybe at a later time)

## Materials needed
- 3D-Printer (Resin printer only, tolerances are intended for accommodating resin shrinkage when curing)
- Key switches from the corresponding manufacturer or compatible clones
- Hot swap sockets (not essential, if intended to be hard-wired) - only to make things neat
- Wires e.g. from 40 pin flat cables
- Diodes
- 2 Microcontrollers (e.g. Teensy or others)

P.S. 
- The project is at an early stage. 
- Test print on your own risk. STL files may need repair prior printing (solid, voids).
- You will need to print 2 thumb clusters, 2 keypads and 58 keycaps (Chose Kailh Box/Cherry or Kailh Choc Type).

## Changelog:
Created by user MageGrey April 19, 2021 under GPL 3.
- 20210421 - Added keycap STL models for Cherry MX, Kailh Choc and Kailh Box variants (different stems).
- 20210421 - Added thumb cluster STL models for Box/Cherry and Choc variants.
- 20210421 - Added keypad STL models.
- 20210424 - Added models of the fully assembled keypads for visual demonstration (without thumb clusters)
