# arcus
This repository was created to document the project for the "arcus" keyboard and release the project files for do-it yourself enthusiasts. 
The name is derived from the Latin word for arch, since the keyboard is of an arched (or curved, bowl-shaped) geometry.

## Files
There will be two versions created:
- One version will feature a Kailh Choc, low-profile compatible keyboard. 
- One version will feature a Kailh Box and Cherry MX compatible keyboard.

The design will include:
- Slots to add the corresponding hotswap sockets, diodes and wiring.
- Modular thumb cluster
- Keycaps for both types of key switches

The keyboards are set up in a 6x4 matrix with a modular 5-Key thumb cluster, so overall there will be 58 keys.
The angles between the rows are 16 degrees and 12 degrees between the columns each.

The overall design is free floating and intended to be fixed to the desk by the 6-1 key. Other positions can work depending on the thumb cluster position.

## Materials needed
- 3D-Printer (Resin printer only, tolerances are intended for accommodating resin shrinkage when curing)
- Key switches from the corresponding manufacturer or compatible
- Hot swap sockets (not essential if intended to be hard-wired)
- Wire
- Diodes

P.S. The project is at an early stage. Test print on your own risk. STL files may need repair prior printing (solid, voids).
